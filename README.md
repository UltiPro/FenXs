# FenXs
FenXs created by Patryk 'UltiPro' WÃ³jtowicz using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages.

FenXs is a website for managing data on a server that was originally intended to host Minecraft servers and FenXs Game. Originally, the project was supposed to be a replacement for the "Nerdownia" project written in PHP, but due to studies and lack of time, the project was abandoned.

Warning:

> This application is my first major project in college, so there is a lot of ugly code. Additionally, instead of using EF Core and Identity, stored procedures and sessions were used. Everything was written from scratch without the use of scaffolding.
